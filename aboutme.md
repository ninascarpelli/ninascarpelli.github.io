# Who is this?

I am a biologist from Brazil currently living in Australia. I did my undergrad in my hometown [(Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais)](https://goo.gl/maps/xsADfCoEFbiZnChi6) and my master's too, both in the same university [(UFMG)](https://ufmg.br/). In Brazil we work as interns in labs and research since day 1 (or at least I did). So since the beginning of my undergrad I worked in a bioacoustics lab that was starting to use Passive Recorders and do some soundscape analysis. It was very good timing because I had the opportunity to participate in almost all the phases to do soundscape research, since buying and importing recorders, learning from scratch how to program them, tests and tests on how much they can record, etc, designing the experiment and so on. It was a very rich experience that made me fall in love with acoustic ecology. I have some published work from this time, one paper on [insect calling activity and the disturbance caused by trucks](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334817818_Effects_of_mining_truck_traffic_on_cricket_calling_activity?_sg=kM9aEF6HJWhss8V2vTKCO-_GulPPARRuwUbw19IvyhTlacX7Ety1ekTUEqUBTREmUt5u4n90GdwOmWCWFzK-CIAHy6FtocqYj9F_wyxW.TkWcq6x3-2ZxHX4Jmx0gyTchJRoVBFlz9J4eA1bvFM6w9wpEdiu_vijUGhGjpJcW80TYLyx7Tn78PDyv67t18A); one of the [effects of hydroelectric noise turbines on fish behaviour](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329138091_Effects_of_hydroelectric_turbine_noise_on_the_behaviour_of_Leporinus_taeniatus_Characiformes_Anostomidae_in_captivity?_sg=kM9aEF6HJWhss8V2vTKCO-_GulPPARRuwUbw19IvyhTlacX7Ety1ekTUEqUBTREmUt5u4n90G0dwOmWCWFzK-CIAHy6FtocqYj9F_wyxW.TkWcq6x3-2ZxHX4Jmx0gyTchJRoVBFlz9J4eA1bvFM6w9wpEdiu_vijUGhGjpJcW80TYLyx7Tn78PDyv67t18A); and another one on the [wildfire impacts in soundscapes in a savanna area ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348591686_Changes_on_soundscapes_reveal_impacts_of_wildfires_in_the_fauna_of_a_Brazilian_savanna?_sg=kM9aEF6HJWhss8V2vTKCO-_GulPPARRuwUbw19IvyhTlacX7Ety1ekTUEqUBTREmUt5u4n90GdwOmWCWFzK-CIAHy6FtocqYj9F_wyxW.TkWcq6x3-2ZxHX4Jmx0gyTchJRoVBFlz9J4eA1bvFM6w9wpEdiu_vijUGhGjpJcW80TYLyx7Tn78PDyv67t18A)

First fieldwork ever

My master's degree was in Environmental Modelling and Environmental Systems Analysis, which is basically learning good modelling practices and a great overview of the tools that are out there. It is very foccused on GIS and Remote Sensing so I ended up with some of those skills too. I published the 2 data chapters of my masters, one of them is a [literature review on soundscapes](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344887037_Gaps_in_terrestrial_soundscape_research_Its_time_to_focus_on_tropical_wildlife?_sg=kM9aEF6HJWhss8V2vTKCO-_GulPPARRuwUbw19IvyhTlacX7Ety1ekTUEqUBTREmUt5u4n90GdwOmWCWFzK-CIAHy6FtocqYj9F_wyxW.TkWcq6x3-2ZxHX4Jmx0gyTchJRoVBFlz9J4eA1bvFM6w9wpEdiu_vijUGhGjpJcW80TYLyx7Tn78PDyv67t18A) and one on [acoustic indices in the Atlantic Forest](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344731814_What_does_Atlantic_Forest_soundscapes_can_tell_us_about_landscape?_sg=kM9aEF6HJWhss8V2vTKCO-_GulPPARRuwUbw19IvyhTlacX7Ety1ekTUEqUBTREmUt5u4n90GdwOmWCWFzK-CIAHy6FtocqYj9F_wyxW.TkWcq6x3-2ZxHX4Jmx0gyTchJRoVBFlz9J4eA1bvFM6w9wpEdiu_vijUGhGjpJcW80TYLyx7Tn78PDyv67t18A).

After the master's I moved to Australia [Brisbane, Queensland](https://goo.gl/maps/ttyfqeVDnE1iBC3QA) to do my PhD in the School of Computer Science (lol) at [QUT](https://www.qut.edu.au/). Here I am part of the [Ecosounds group](https://research.ecosounds.org/), which is a bunch of very nice researchers trying to delevop tools and study acoustic ecology. I am also part of the [Fuller's Conservation group](https://fullerecologylab.wordpress.com/) which is another bunch of very cool researchers trying to answer ecological questions that will -hopefully- contribute to conservation actions and management. I have a supervisory team of 3 people (lucky girl): one computer scientist and two ecologists. So I am currently sitting in the middle of both sciences, trying to help building this bridge.

The goal of this blog is for me to learn and improve my Markdown and git skills as a part of a casual job but I thought to make the most out of it and try to **finally** make my stuff more available and user-friendly. I hope someone finds this useful. Any questions, suggestions etc, you can find me on [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marina-Scarpelli), [GitHub](https://github.com/ninascarpelli) and recently [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scarpellinina) - must say I'm not very active on that one to be honest.

Ah, by the way, my name is Marina, but I usually go as Nina.
